To Run the application
Copy the files into the OWASP BWA virtual machine(Except the WAF folder).
The path for the folders to be replaced is /owaspbwa/owaspbwa-svn/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/yazd
Then replace the content of the WAF folder to /owaspbwa/owasp-modsecurity-crs-git
You can activate WAF by using this commands 
go to this folder    /var/log/apache2/
Run this commands
owaspbwa-modsecurity-crs-log.sh
owaspbwa-modsecurity-crs-block.sh
To deactivate 
owaspbwa-modsecurity-crs-off.sh

We decided to work on the OWASP BWA because apache2 and tomcat6 are preinstalled.
